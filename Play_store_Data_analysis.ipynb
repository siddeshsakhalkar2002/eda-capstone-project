        "The Google Play Store, previously known as the Android Market, is an online platform operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on the Android operating system and its derivatives, as well as ChromeOS. Users can access and download applications developed using the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. Additionally, Google Play also functions as a digital media store, offering a wide range of content such as games, music, books, movies, and television programs.\n",

        "In our current project, we have been provided with two datasets: Play Store data and User Reviews. Let's examine these datasets in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. playstore data.csv: This file contains comprehensive information about various applications available on Google Play. It includes 13 different features that describe each app.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. user reviews.csv: This dataset consists of 100 reviews for each application, sorted in order of helpfulness. The reviews have undergone preprocessing and now include three new features: Sentiment (categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity, and Sentiment Subjectivity.\n",

        "4. Bivariate Analysis: This analysis investigates the relationships and dependencies between two attributes, looking for causal connections.\n",

        "5. Multivariate Analysis: When dealing with more than two variables simultaneously, we perform multivariate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Data Cleaning: We will clean the dataset by handling missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Testing Hypothesis: Before applying multivariate techniques, we will verify if our data meets the necessary assumptions.\n",
